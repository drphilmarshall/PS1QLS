\begin{abstract}

Gravitationally lensed quasars enable a wide range of astrophysical
investigations, most of which are currently limited by the available sample
size. The Pan-STARRS 1 quasar lens search (PS1QLS) aims to supply this demand,
using the 30,000 square degree, multi-filter, multi-epoch ``$3\pi$'' imaging
dataset of the PS1 project.  In this paper we describe the preparation of the
imaging and catalog data in the PS1--SDSS DR7 overlap area, and our target
selection, using SDSS colors, SDSS--PS1 variability and PS1 spatial extent.
These targets will  be analyzed robotically in a companion paper.  We show
that our target selection recovers N\% of the known lenses in the search area,
and, using realistic synthetic systems, should be X\% complete.

% The PS1QLS series.

This paper is organized as follows... Throughout this paper, and the
rest of the PS1QLS series, magnitudes are given in the AB system
\citep{Oke74} and we adopt standard ``concordance'' cosmological
parameters, i.e. $h=0.7$, $\Omega_m=0.3$ and $\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$, where
the symbols indicate the Hubble Constant in units of 100 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ and the matter and dark energy density of the Universe in
units of the critical density \citep[e.g.\ ][]{Kom++09}.
