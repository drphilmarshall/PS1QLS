\begin{abstract}

Gravitationally lensed quasars enable a wide range of astrophysical
investigations, most of which are currently limited by the available
sample size. The Pan-STARRS 1 quasar lens search (PS1QLS) aims to supply
this demand, using the 30,000 square degree, multi-filter, multi-epoch
``$3\pi$'' imaging dataset of the PS1 project.  In this paper we
describe: the preparation of the imaging and catalog data in the
PS1--SDSS DR7 overlap area, our target selection, using SDSS colors,
SDSS--PS1 variability and PS1 spatial extent, and our robotic approach
to the analysis of the targets. We show that our target selection
recovers N\% of the known lenses in the search area, and, using
realistic synthetic systems, should be X\% complete.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


% Motivation.


% History. Future.


% Photometric quasar selection: Richards et al.


% Spatial extent: SQLS


% Follow-up: SQLS. PS1 as its own follow-up.


% Towards automated lens analysis: HAGGLes etc


% The PS1QLS series.

This paper is organized as follows... Throughout this paper, and the
rest of the PS1QLS series, magnitudes are given in the AB system
\citep{Oke74} and we adopt standard ``concordance'' cosmological
parameters, i.e. $h=0.7$, $\Omega_m=0.3$ and $\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$, where
the symbols indicate the Hubble Constant in units of 100 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ and the matter and dark energy density of the Universe in
units of the critical density \citep[e.g.\ ][]{Kom++09}.
